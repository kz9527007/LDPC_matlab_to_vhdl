This project takes the methods described by Dr. Yuan Jiang in his book "A Practical Guide to Error-Control Coding Using MATLAB" and MATLAB's hdl-coder to create implemetable vhdl for use in the fabric of a FPGA.  

This method was only created to test how much fabric space is taken up and what the timing of the encoding/decoding method. 

As of 4/8/2019 the decoding method isn't complete and is only used to encode one string.
